**Automatic and Manual Fire Alarm Detector**  
   - Description:
   - **Normal Condition**:  
      The thermistor does not detect heat, and the infrared sensor does not detect any flames. The green LED lights up to indicate a safe condition, and the buzzer remains off with no alert.
   - **Spark Detected Condition**:  
      The infrared sensor detects a spark and sends a HIGH signal, while the thermistor remains LOW as it does not detect heat. The red LED lights up to warn of the spark. If there is uncertainty, the user can     press the manual button to activate the alarm.
   - **Fire Condition**:  
      The thermistor detects high temperature and sends a HIGH signal, and the infrared sensor detects flames and also sends a HIGH signal. When both sensors (heat and flame) send a HIGH signal, the system detects a fire. The red LED lights up, and the buzzer activates to issue a fire warning.
